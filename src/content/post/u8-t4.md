## Computer Misuse Act 1990

The Computer Misuse Act of 1990 is a law in the United Kingdom that makes certain activities illegal, such as hacking into other peopleâ€™s systems, misusing software, or helping a person to gain access to protected files of someone else's computer.

## Consumer Credit Act 1974

The Consumer Credit Act 1974 requires most businesses that lend money to consumers or offer goods or services on credit or engage in certain ancillary credit activities to be licensed by the OFT. Trading without a licence in such cases is a criminal offence and can result in a fine and/or imprisonment.

These rights are in consonance with copyright laws in India. Once this is done, the rights can be licensed, transferred or assigned. However, the copyright is granted for certain period of time. The copyright issues in India are addressed by the Copyright Act, 1957.
